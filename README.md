# JStreams 1.0

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/amoerie/jstreams.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/amoerie/jstreams)

Contains Java 6 compatible streams that are immutable, lazy and chainable.

- For the C# developers: This library looks A LOT like Linq To Objects, the only difference being that the method names are more conventional ('filter' instead of 'Where', etc.).

- For the javascript developers: This library looks A LOT like lodash, underscore, ... 

*Important features*

1. Streams are immutable. Once a stream has been created, you cannot change it. The only thing you can do is make new streams starting from that stream. 
2. Streams are lazy. Enumerating the elements of a stream is always postponed as much as possible. There are some methods which absolutely require iteration, which I call "greedy operators". Some examples of greedy operators are `sortBy`, `length`, `toList` and `last`. Most operators are lazy, these are delayed until a greedy operator is called.
For example, you can do the following:
```java
      List<String> firstFiveStrings = Stream.create(infiniteStrings).take(5).toList();
```

3. Stream operators are chainable, allowing you to do complex things with simple compositions.

## Why did you make this, I thought Java had streams now?

The reasons I created this are:

- Android does not run Java 8. Even with Retrolambda, which introduces the nice arrow syntax, you still don't get the Streams because those are only included in the actual JDK 8.
- Other libraries that attempt this sort of thing are either outdated, not well documented or are very bloated.

This library is explicitly called JStreams to accentuate how it's mostly the same thing as Java 8 streams. If you can use JDK 8, you probably should not use this.

## How do I use this

You can use Maven! Add this to your `<dependencies>` in your pom.xml:

```xml
      <dependency>
            <groupId>com.amoerie</groupId>
            <artifactId>jstreams</artifactId>
            <version>1.0</version>
      </dependency>
```

Or if you use Gradle, add this to your `build.gradle` file 

```groovy
    compile 'com.amoerie:jstreams:1.0'
```

Or you can just download the latest jar file from [the releases page](https://github.com/amoerie/jstreams/releases)!

## Roadmap

- 1.1 will be released beginning of November 2015, fixing a few bugs, adding a couple of operators such as `distinct`, `toMap` and adding some aliases.

## Pull requests

I am taking pull requests! This library is quite minimal, so I expect there to be times when the API is a bit too limited to satisfy all your needs. 

#### Getting started

1. Import this project into your IDE of choice as a Gradle project. There is no other special setup you need to do.

#### Guidelines 

If you want to make sure your pull request gets accepted, follow these guidelines:

- Follow functional conventions. If you add a method that does not exist in any other language or framework, rethink what you're doing. If it does exist elsewhere, find the name that is most commonly used across languages/frameworks.

- Write at least 3 unit tests covering the empty stream scenario, a "happy case" scenario and an infinite stream scenario (if applicable). See the existing tests. 

- Write javadoc for the public parts of the API.
 
Other tips:

- Try to reuse existing operators. For example, `toList` and `length`are just specialized use cases of `reduce`
- Try to avoid writing code inside the Stream base class. See the private `FlatStream`, `MappedStream`, ... classes if you need an example.

### `public abstract class Stream<E> implements Iterable<E>`

### `public static <E> Stream<E> create(final Iterable<E> iterable)`

Creates a new stream from the provided iterable This is a lazy operation, it does not consume the iterable until a consuming operation is called, such as toList()

 * **Parameters:**
   * `iterable` — an iterable containing elements
   * `<E>` — the type of an element
 * **Returns:** a new stream containing the elements of the iterable

### `public <C> Stream<C> cast(final Class<C> clazz)`

Casts every element of this stream to another class

 * **Parameters:**
   * `clazz` — the class to cast to
   * `<C>` — the type of the class to cast to
 * **Returns:** a new stream containing every element casted to another class

### `public Stream<E> concat(final Stream<E> other)`

Concatenates this stream with another stream

 * **Parameters:** `other` — the other stream to concatenate with
 * **Returns:** a new stream containing all the elements of this stream and the other stream

### `public Stream<E> filter(final Filter<E> filter)`

Filters the elements of this stream with the given filter.

 * **Parameters:** `filter` — the predicate that returns true or false for a given element
 * **Returns:** a new stream containing only the elements that satisfied the filter

### `public E first()`

Gets the first element of this stream

### `public <R> Stream<R> flatMap(final Mapper<E, Stream<R>> mapper)`

Maps each element of this stream to a separate stream, and then flattens the result to one single stream

 * **Parameters:**
   * `mapper` — the function that turns one element into a stream of values
   * `<R>` — the type of one mapped element

### `public Stream<E> sort(final Comparator<E> comparator)`

Sorts this stream using the provided comparator. This operator is lazy but greedy, meaning that it will wait as long as possible to actually materialize your stream to sort it.
